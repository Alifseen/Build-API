# Weather data API
I created an API with a basic HTML Documentation page using flask and pandas.

This API gets data from **first 100 stations** across all stations in europe. 

The data is extracted from txt files, converted to data frames, processes and then converted to either dictionaries, or html table based on the requirement.
