Flask:
Flask runs a webapp created with html/css through a python file

@app.route("/linkpath") is used to point and open different pages. It requires defining a function that returns something, which can be html page, or dictionary etc.

To return a page, use render template method and point to a file templates folder

@app.route can take values from the url using the <> symbol and add them to the function defined below it.
For example abc.com/<dynamic>
def foo(dynamic)
    ...

Note that images are not rendered unless stored in a folder called static and the html img src using this syntax:
img src "{{url_for 'static', filename='imagename.type'}}"

use app.run(debug=True) to run the app and use debug set to True to be able to see any errors in python file on the webpage

Use if __name__ == __main__ conditional to run app, so that it only runs when it is called by itself. Be sure to define the app name to __name__

All fask app run on port 5000 by default, to run multiple apps, define other port in run method. E.g. app.run(port=5001)

You can inject HTML to an HTML file by storing HTML code in a variable and assigning that variable to another variable in render_template. Eg. render_template("html.html", variable=variable_with_HTML_code)
Then simply add the variable in HTML file where you want it to be injected with keyword "safe" for it to be rendered by flask. eg. {{variable|safe}}


Pandas:

skiprows argument - eg skiprows=20
parse_dates argument - eg parse_dates=["columnname that has dates"]

series object - when there is one column only. eg df["columnname"]
.mean method - applies mean to a series
.max or .min method - gets max or min values from the series
.squeeze method - gets the actual value from a cell
.astype - read a column as another datatype


dataframe object - multiple columns. eg eg df[["columnname1", "columnname2"]]
.columns method - display column names
.loc method - an instance of df (doesnt change original) by taking a condition or coordinates. condition eg df.loc[df["columnname"] != value] , coordinate eg df.loc[index, column name]
.mask method - stores the values to remove. Eg df["columnname"].mask(df["columnname2"] == value, value to be replaced with)
.to_html() - convert dataframe to html table
.to_dict() - convert dataframe to dict, to get 1 dict per row add (orient="records")


Matplotlib:
.hist - histogram
.plot - takes x coordinate, y coordinate and size of plot. Eg. df.plot(x="columnname", y="columnname2", figsize=(width, height))



Numpy:
.nan method - symbolizes none values



string method:
.zfill() -  the file name from the url


rest API
only dictionary or list are allowed to be returned in REST Api since it only accepts JSON
